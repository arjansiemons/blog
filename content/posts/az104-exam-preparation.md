Tomorrow's the big day - I'm taking my Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) certification exam. In this post, I'll share my preparation journey and some final thoughts before the exam.

I have worked with Azure for several years, mainly with VMs, App Services, Storage, Application Gateways, Azure SQL, and more. I learned everything by reading documentation and hands-on experience. I had no colleagues to learn from. In 2022, I got my AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals certification. I decided to go for the Azure Administrator certification to validate my knowledge and skills.

It has been very interesting to learn so much more during this process.

How I prepared:

I started with the official [Microsoft Learn modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/?practice-assessment-type=certification#certification-prepare-for-the-exam). I went through all of them and did the exercises. I also did the labs on Microsoft Learn. I found them very helpful, but also a bit boring.

I bought the [measureup practice exam](https://www.measureup.com/microsoft-practice-test-az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator.html). I took practice exams, trying to understand the questions really well, and also understanding why the correct answer is the correct answer. Then I reviewed the questions I got wrong and did some extra learning on those topics where needed. Then I took a practice exam with only the questions I got wrong. I did this until I got 100% on the practice exam.

I watched the [John Savill AZ-104 Exam Cram video](https://youtu.be/0Knf9nub4-k) on YouTube. I found it very helpful.

I also used [Claude](https://claude.ai) to help me test my knowledge of the different concepts and to explain things in more detail.

I did the [Microsoft AZ-104 labs](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator).

While I think I'm well prepared, I'm still a bit nervous. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm looking forward to the challenge. I chose to take the exam in person at a test center. I've never tried OnVue, and I don't need the extra stress of possible issues with that.
