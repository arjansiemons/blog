Tomorrow's the big day - I'm taking my Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) certification exam. In this post, I'll share my preparation journey and some final thoughts before the exam.

Over the past few years, I've worked with various Azure services - mainly VMs, App Services, Storage, Application Gateways, and Azure SQL. My learning journey has been mostly self-guided through documentation and hands-on experience, without having colleagues to learn from. After getting my AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals certification in 2022, going for the Azure Administrator certification felt like a natural next step to validate my knowledge and skills.

The preparation process has taught me a lot of interesting things beyond my day-to-day work with Azure.

My preparation started with the official [Microsoft Learn modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/?practice-assessment-type=certification#certification-prepare-for-the-exam). Working through all the modules and labs was very helpful, though sometimes a bit boring.

To test my knowledge, I bought the [MeasureUp practice exam](https://www.measureup.com/microsoft-practice-test-az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator.html). For each practice exam, I focused on really understanding the questions and why certain answers were correct. After reviewing the questions I got wrong, I did extra learning on those topics. Then I took practice exams with just those questions until I got them all right.

The [John Savill AZ-104 Exam Cram video](https://youtu.be/0Knf9nub4-k) on YouTube was particularly helpful. I also used [Claude](https://claude.ai) to test my understanding of different concepts and get more detailed explanations.

For hands-on practice, I completed the [Microsoft AZ-104 labs](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator).

While I feel well-prepared, there are still some nerves about tomorrow. Not sure exactly what to expect, but I'm looking forward to the challenge. I decided to take the exam at a test center instead of using OnVue - no need for extra stress from potential technical issues.
