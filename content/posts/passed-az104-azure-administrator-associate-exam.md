Last Wednesday, I successfully completed the AZ-104 Azure Administrator Associate exam. I opted to take it at a test center rather than using OnVue's remote proctoring service, as I wanted to avoid any additional stress from unfamiliar testing procedures. The test center experience was excellent - the staff were welcoming and professional. After completing the necessary paperwork, having my photo taken, verifying my ID, and securing my belongings in a locker, I was able to begin the exam ahead of schedule.

The examination proved to be significantly more challenging than anticipated. Despite feeling well-prepared beforehand, my confidence wavered during the actual test. I utilized the full time allocation to meticulously review my answers, only to discover there was an extensive case study waiting at the end with merely three minutes remaining. Nevertheless, I'm pleased to announce that I passed. From my experience, I found the MeasureUp practice exams to be considerably easier compared to the actual certification exam.

My next goal is tackling the AZ-400 Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions certification. Having spent several years designing and maintaining Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines, I'm hopeful this practical experience will prove beneficial.
